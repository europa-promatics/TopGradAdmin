graduating from my Bachelor of Design, I am interested in KOJO’s junior designer opportunity. My passion for design and skills for both physical and digital applications illustrate my fit for the position. As part of my degree and design volunteering opportunities – most recently under AZNZINE – I have learnt how to work creatively and efficiently with others from creative idea conceptualisation to delivery, while staying within a brand’s style and values. This encompasses a broad array of mediums and intentions; including animation, signage, social media, visual presentations, web design, layout design, and illustrated assets. Working with a range of people – both locally and internationally – I’ve tackled working around time differences, been responsive, collaborative, and proactive; while always seeking feedback to develop and grow my design.<br> \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI am proficient and comfortable with the Adobe Creative Suite, especially InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator; and can extend my static designs into motion with Premiere Pro and After Effects. On the more traditional side, I also spend time fine tuning typography selection, placement, and keeping an eye on good publication design. Learning about human interaction through my digital technologies major, I have a keen eye, technical understanding, and passion to design for easy interaction and to think deeply about user experiences. While offering my skills, I would also appreciate the opportunity to learn from and develop alongside the Melbourne KOJO team.<br> \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAs an efficient and driven individual, I pride myself in my flexibly and time management skills; developed through volunteer coordination and serving as a university club president in 2020. Especially under conditions presented by the pandemic, I understand the need to communicate well, think on one’s feet, and the importance of bringing initiative to the table in order to work efficiently as a team in a fast-paced environment. With the few sentences written here and selected works on my portfolio sell short in showing fully what I can offer KOJO. I would love the opportunity to elaborate in an interview.<br> \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI am confident with my skills and experience to effectively undertake the role of your junior designer. Thank you for your consideration and I hope to hear from you soon.<br> \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tYours sincerely,<br>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNathan Jones\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t      \\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t<div class=\\\"lettrscreening_form ansquestn_Box\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t<h5>Answered questions</h5>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t<form>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\\"form-group position-relative\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<label>How many years of industry UI/UX experience have you had?</label>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div class=\\\"anserd_brdrbox\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t            \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
